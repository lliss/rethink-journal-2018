<h2 id="presentations-and-conclusion">Presentations and Conclusion</h2>
<p>During our Monday checkin we examined unplugged computer science exercises used to teach binary numbers. We also reviewed our latest work as a group. Jay and I did our final adjustments to our posters and submitted them to be printed.</p>
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday were spent completing my lesson plan which involved writing some experimental software that uses an SVM algorithm to predict movie likes and dislikes based on a training set. This will be the hands on component of my lesson. I also spend time fixing minor errors in my Python program which prevent it from running if a small sample image is used.</p>
<p>Thursday we met as a group for final meetings and to tie up loose ends. We had a group lunch and discussed our parting thoughts on the program and then completed our poster presentations.</p>
<p>The entire experience was excellent and I look forward to applying again next year.</p>
